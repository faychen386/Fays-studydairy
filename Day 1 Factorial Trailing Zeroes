Factorial Trailing Zeroes :   the factorial of an intergerï¼Œ how many tailing Zeroes of it ? 3!=3 * 2* 1= 6 , here is 0; 300 = 74;
Basis Rule: 
The quotient of the divisor(n as original input interger)  will be accumulated added as the number of tailing Zeroes.
5 as Denominator
here we go:

  def trailingZeroes(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0     #  0!=1, no 
        count = 0        # set the initial value of zero
        while n !=0:     # set the loop
            tem = n //5  # get the first number
            count+=tem    # accumulated the counts
            n//=5         # to ge the next n in  the next step
        reurn count      # finally when the loop breaks, then we get the count, here is the trailing zeros number of factorial
        
  Tipps :  get th rules, the regular things !
